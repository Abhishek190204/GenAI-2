# Generative AI Assignment
<ul>
<li>Compared the performance of VAE(Variational Auto-Encoders) , GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) and Diffusion model on how well they can generate new samples for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
<li>Performed image-to-image translation, i.e translating or converting a source image into a target image while modifying certain visual properties of the image as per the requirement and preserving the rest of the properties.
    Compared the latent dimension vector arithmetic using DCGAN and CycleGAN with image level arithmetic for the same. 
</ul>
